<p>I'm a Solutions professional with over a decade of experience helping businesses—from startups to Fortune 500s—solve complex challenges through enterprise SaaS and cloud-based solutions. I specialize in pre-sales strategy, technical discovery, and workflow optimization, with a focus on turning technology into measurable business outcomes.</p>


<p>Over the years, I’ve delivered hundreds of product demonstrations to C-level stakeholders, led solution consulting teams, and contributed to software sales exceeding $10M annually. I thrive at the intersection of technology, strategy, and client success—whether I’m collaborating with internal teams, enabling partners, or guiding enterprise clients through their digital transformation journey.</p>


<p>Outside of work, I’m passionate about long-distance running and have completed several marathons. Running keeps me focused, disciplined, and always striving for improvement—values I carry into my professional life. Most importantly, I’m a proud husband and father, and my family is at the heart of everything I do.</p>
