## About Me

I'm a Solutions Consultant with over a decade of experience helping organizations—ranging from SMBs to Fortune 500s—solve complex business challenges through enterprise SaaS and cloud-based solutions.

My focus is on pre-sales strategy, technical discovery, and workflow optimization, all aimed at driving measurable business value. I've led hundreds of product demos for C-level IT stakeholders, supported multi-million-dollar software engagements, and built pre-sales teams that enable scalable growth. I’m also experienced in aligning product capabilities with client needs to support long-term success.

Beyond the technical work, I take pride in building strong relationships—with clients, partners, and cross-functional teams—and being a trusted advisor in digital transformation efforts.

Outside of work, I’m a dedicated marathon runner and a proud husband and father. My family keeps me grounded, and long-distance running fuels the discipline and focus I bring into every aspect of my career.
